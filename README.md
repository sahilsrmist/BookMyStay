## 🎯 Goal
Establish a clear and predictable starting point for the Hotel Booking application by demonstrating how a Java program begins execution and produces console output.

## 👤 Actor
**User** – runs the application from the command line or IDE.

## 🔄 Flow
1. User runs the application.
2. JVM invokes the `main()` method.
3. Application prints a welcome message along with the application name and version.
4. Application terminates.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

* **Class:** Even the simplest Java application must be defined inside a class. The class acts as a container for application behavior and marks the logical boundary of the program.
* **`main()` Method:** The main method is the entry point of every standalone Java application. The JVM looks specifically for the method signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`.
* **`static` Keyword:** The `main()` method is declared static so that it can be executed without creating an object of the class. This allows the JVM to start execution directly.
* **Console Output:** `System.out.println()` is used to send text output to the console. This is the simplest way to observe program behavior during early development.
* **String Literals:** Text enclosed in double quotes (e.g., `"Hotel Booking System v1.0"`) is treated as a String literal, which is immutable and stored in the String pool.
* **Method Invocation:** Calling `println()` on the `out` object demonstrates how methods are invoked on objects in Java, even in basic programs.
* **Application Flow:** Execution proceeds top to bottom inside the `main()` method unless altered by control structures. This use case reinforces linear execution flow.
* **JavaDoc Comments:** JavaDoc comments are used to document the class and its purpose. They serve as the foundation for professional code documentation.
* **JavaDoc Annotations:** Tags such as `@author` and `@version` provide metadata about the class and help maintain traceability as the system evolves.

## ✅ Key Requirements

- [ ] Create a Java class that represents the application entry point.
- [ ] Implement the `main()` method using the correct signature.
- [ ] Print a welcome message to the console.
- [ ] Display the application name and version information.
- [ ] Use JavaDoc comments to document the class and its intent.
- [ ] Ensure the program executes and terminates without errors.
